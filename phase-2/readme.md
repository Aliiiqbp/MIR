# Machine Learning Models in Information Retrieval

In this project I implement variety of models in machine learning and use them for some info. retrieval tasks.
models and their descriptions are as below:

### Classification Models:
* NaiveBayes
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vectore Machine
* Multi-Layer Perceptron
### Clustering Models:
* Kmeans
* Gaussian Mixture Model
* Hierarchical Clustering

### Libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Seaborn / Matplotlib

I also had to do some tasks to prepare and visualize datas for better performance like:
* PCA
* Visualization with Dimensionality Reduction
* Implement Score functions
