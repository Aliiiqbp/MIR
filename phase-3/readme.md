# Implementation Web Crawler and PageRank Algorithms

In this phase I implement some page rank algorithms and crawl on [academic.microsoft](academic.microsoft.com "Named link title") for creating graph of papers.

### Tasks:
* Implement Crawler
* Evaluate crawled papers with pagerank
* Rank paper's publishers with HITS algorithm
* Implement a recommender system on crawled graph:
  * Content-based
  * Collaborative Filtering

### Libraries:
* Selenium
* Numpy
* Json
